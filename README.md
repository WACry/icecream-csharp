### IceCream ‚Äî Never use print() to debug again

Do you ever use `Console.WriteLine()` to debug your code? Of course you
do. IceCream, or `ic` for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.

`ic()` is like `print()` in Python, except it's better:

1. Detailed Printing: IceCream prints not only values but also contextual information, including the filename,
   timestamp, line number, label, and parent function (optional).
2. Redesigned for C#: The tool has been redesigned to work with C#.
3. Simplicity: IceCream is designed for simplicity and is 60% faster to use compared to other debugging tools.
4. Rich Output Formatting: IceCream offers the capability to format and colorize your debugging output in one line,
   enhancing its informativeness and visual appeal.
5. Flexible Configuration: You can configure various settings in IceCream to customize your debugging output according
   to your specific needs.
6. Output Customization: You can further customize the debugging output by adding labels, prefixes, and more to suit
   your preferences.

IceCream is well tested, [permissively licensed](LICENSE), and
supports mostly all versions of .NET.

### Install and Import

First, add the library to your project package references in your `.csproj` file.

```
<PackageReference Include="icecream"/>
```

Or, use the dotnet CLI.

```
$ dotnet add package icecream
```

After the package is installed, import it in your code.

```csharp
using icecream;
```

### Quick Start

```csharp
"Hello World".ic("Label");
var x = 12.ic() + 2;
x.ic("x");
(1, 2).ic();
```

Prints as:

```
üçß| Program.cs:1 in Main() at 06:33:13.723 - Label: "Hello World"
üçß| Program.cs:2 in Main() at 06:33:13.761 - 12
üçß| Program.cs:3 in Main() at 06:33:13.766 - x: 14
üçß| Program.cs:4 in Main() at 06:33:13.767 - {Item1: 1, Item2: 2}
```

As you can see, you can add `.ic()` almost ANYWHERE and have no impact on the code logic because it returns the original
value. They don't have syntax color in this README document, but they do in your console. üòÉ

In Python, `ic(foo(123))` could print something like `ic| foo(123): 456`. However, it's impossible to do that in
Java or C# because of the way the language is designed. In this case I believe `obj.ic()` is more elegant
than `ic(obj)`.
You can easily add them and remove them all with `Replace All` in your IDE.

However, if you really want to use the traditional way, you can still do it with `ic(obj)`. You need
to `using static icecream.IceCreamTraditional;` first.

Usually, you don't need to add a label to the output because the context information is already enough.
While, you can still add an optional label to the output by passing a string as `.ic(label)` like the first example.

### Print Anything

We use `JsonConvert.SerializeObject()` (all versions supported) to convert the object to a string in default. It is
powerful and is able to print
much more types than `JsonSerializer.Serialize()`. You can define your own `ArgToStringFunction` to parse the object to
a string in your own
way too.

```csharp
_str = "abc";
_num = 123;
_dbl = 123.456;
_boolean = true;
_obj = new { a = 1, b = "2", c = new { d = 3, e = new { f = 4 } } };
_dict = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "a", 1 },
    { "b", "2" },
    { "c", new { d = 3, e = new { f = 4 } } },
    { "d", new Dictionary<string, TestClass> { { "test", new TestClass() } } }
};
_list = new List<object> { 1, "2", new { d = 3, e = new { f = 4 } }, new TestClass() };
_arr = new string[] { "a", "b", "c" };
_kvp = new KeyValuePair<string, object>("a", 1);
_tuple = (1, 3.14f, true, new TestClass());
_testClass = new TestClass();
_testEnum = TestEnum.A;
```

```
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.146 - "abc"
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.189 - 123
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.192 - 123.456
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.193 - true
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.194 - {"a": 1, "b": "2", "c": {"d": 3, "e": {"f": 4}}}
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.224 - {"a": 1, "b": "2", "c": {"d": 3, "e": {"f": 4}}, "d": {"test": {"PublicInt": 2, "PublicString": "public"}}}
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.230 - [1, "2", {"d": 3, "e": {"f": 4}}, {"PublicInt": 2, "PublicString": "public"}]
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.232 - ["a", "b", "c"]
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.233 - {"Key": "a", "Value": 1}
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.236 - {"Item1": 1, "Item2": 3.14, "Item3": true, "Item4": {"PublicInt": 2, "PublicString": "public"}}
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.238 - {"PublicInt": 2, "PublicString": "public"}
üçß| Program.cs:15 in Main() at 06:52:17.238 - "A"
```

### Logging

`.IceFormat()` is like `ic()` but the output is returned as a string instead

```csharp
var str = "hello".IceFormat();
```

`str` is now `üçß| Program.cs:1 in Main() at 06:33:13.723 - "hello"`.

### Enable/Disable

```csharp
IceCream.Enable(); // Enable IceCream
IceCream.Disable(); // Disable IceCream
```

### Configuration

Here's a overview of the settings:

```csharp
 public class IceCreamSettings
 {
     public bool IncludeContext { get; set; } = true;
     public string Prefix { get; set; } = "\ud83c\udf67| ";
     public bool UseAbsPath { get; set; } = false;
     public Action<string> OutputAction { get; set; } = null;
     public Func<object, string> ArgToStringFunction { get; set; } = null;
     public ConsoleColor? LabelColor { get; set; } = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue;
     public ConsoleColor? FieldColor { get; set; } = ConsoleColor.DarkRed;
     public ConsoleColor? ValueColor { get; set; } = ConsoleColor.DarkCyan;
     public Encoding Encoding { get; set; } = Encoding.UTF8;
 }
 ```

Use `IceCream.Configure(IceCreamSettings settings)` to configure IceCream. You can only set the properties you want to
change, and the rest will be set to default values. Also, call `IceCream.Configure()` directly resets all settings.

1. `IncludeContext` (default: `true`): Whether to include context information (line number, parent function, etc.) in
   the output.
2. `Prefix` (default: `üçß| `): The prefix of the output.
3. `UseAbsPath` (default: `false`): Whether to use absolute path of the file or the file name only.
4. `OutputAction` (default: `null`): The action to output the result. If it is `null`, the result will be output to
   `Console.WriteLine()` with the color set in `LabelColor`, `FieldColor` and `ValueColor`.
5. `ArgToStringFunction` (default: `obj => JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, new StringEnumConverter())`): The function
   converting the object to a string. If it is `null`, the default function will be used.
6. `LabelColor` (default: `ConsoleColor.DarkBlue`): The color of the label.
7. `FieldColor` (default: `ConsoleColor.DarkRed`): The color of the field.
8. `ValueColor` (default: `ConsoleColor.DarkCyan`): The color of the value.
9. `Encoding` (default: `Encoding.UTF8`): The encoding of the output.

Alternatively, you can use `IceCream.SetXxx(newValue)` (e.g. `IceCream.SetPrefix("ic>")`) to set a single setting. These
functions won't reset other settings.
