### IceCream ‚Äî Never use Console to debug again

Do you ever use `Console.WriteLine()` to debug your code? Of course you
do. IceCream, or `ic` for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.

`.ic()` is like `print()` in Python, except it's better:

1. Detailed Printing: IceCream prints not only values but also contextual information, including the filename,
   timestamp, line number, label, and parent function (optional).
2. Redesigned for C#: The tool has been redesigned to work with C#.
3. Simplicity: IceCream is designed for simplicity and is 60% faster to use compared to other debugging tools.
4. Flexible Configuration: You can configure various settings in IceCream to customize your debugging output according
   to your specific needs.
5. Output Customization: You can further customize the debugging output by adding labels, prefixes, and more to suit
   your preferences.

IceCream is well tested, [permissively licensed](LICENSE), and
supports .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET Framework 4.5.

### Install and Import

First, add the library to your project package references in your `.csproj` file.

```
<PackageReference Include="icecream"/>
```

Or, use the dotnet CLI.

```
$ dotnet add package icecream
```

After the package is installed, import it in your code.

```csharp
using icecream;
```

### Quick Start

```csharp
int foo(int x) => x + 1;
var x = 1;
var dict = new Dictionary<string, int> { { "a", 1 }, { "b", 2 } };

x.ic();
foo(foo(2)).ic("call foo twice");
var y = foo(x.ic("ic() returns the original value")) * 2;
(y, dict).ic("multiple values");
```

Prints as:

```
üçß| Program.cs:5 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - x:1
üçß| Program.cs:6 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - foo(foo(2)):4, label:call foo twice
üçß| Program.cs:7 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - x:1, label: ic() returns the original value
üçß| Program.cs:8 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - (y, dict):{"Item1":4,"Item2":{"a":1,"b":2}}, label:multiple values
```

As you may noticed, you can add `.ic()` almost ANYWHERE and have no impact on the code logic because it returns the original
value.

I believe `obj.ic()` is more elegant than `ic(obj)`. For example, You can easily add them with one mouse click, 
and remove them all with `Replace All` in your IDE. However, if you really want to use the traditional way `ic(obj)` as 
in icecream-python, you can still do it by `using static icecream.IceCreamTraditional;`.

### Print Anything

We use `JsonConvert.SerializeObject()` to convert the object to a string in default. It is
powerful and is able to print
much more types than `JsonSerializer.Serialize()`. You can define your own `ArgToStringFunction` to parse the object to
a string in your own way too.

```csharp
str = "abc";
num = 123;
dbl = 123.456;
boolean = true;
obj = new { a = 1, b = "2", c = new { d = 3, e = new { f = 4 } } };
dict = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "a", 1 },
    { "b", "2" },
    { "c", new { d = 3, e = new { f = 4 } } },
    { "d", new Dictionary<string, TestClass> { { "test", new TestClass() } } }
};
list = new List<object> { 1, "2", new { d = 3, e = new { f = 4 } }, new TestClass() };
arr = new string[] { "a", "b", "c" };
kvp = new KeyValuePair<string, object>("a", 1);
tuple = (1, 3.14f, true, new TestClass());
testClass = new TestClass();
testEnum = TestEnum.A;
```

```
üçß| Program.cs:1 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - str:"abc"
üçß| Program.cs:2 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - num:123
üçß| Program.cs:3 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - dbl:123.456
üçß| Program.cs:4 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - boolean:true
üçß| Program.cs:5 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - obj:{"a":1,"b":"2","c":{"d":3,"e":{"f":4}}}
üçß| Program.cs:6 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - dict:{"a":1,"b":"2","c":{"d":3,"e":{"f":4}},"d":{"test":{"a":1,"b":"2"}}}
üçß| Program.cs:7 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - list:[1,"2",{"d":3,"e":{"f":4}},{"a":1,"b":"2"}]
üçß| Program.cs:8 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - arr:["a","b","c"]
üçß| Program.cs:9 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - kvp:{"Key":"a","Value":1}
üçß| Program.cs:10 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - tuple:{"Item1":1,"Item2":3.14,"Item3":true,"Item4":{"a":1,"b":"2"}}
üçß| Program.cs:11 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - testClass:{"a":1,"b":"2"}
üçß| Program.cs:12 in Main() at 00:00:00.000 - testEnum:"A"
```

### Logging

`.IceFormat()` is like `.ic()` but the output is returned as a string instead

```csharp
var str = "hello";
logger.LogInfo(str.IceFormat());
```

### Enable/Disable

```csharp
IceCream.Enable(); // Enable IceCream
IceCream.Disable(); // Disable IceCream
```

### Configuration

Here's a overview of the settings:

```csharp
 public class IceCreamSettings
 {
     public bool IncludeContext { get; set; } = true;
     public string Prefix { get; set; } = "\ud83c\udf67| ";
     public bool UseAbsPath { get; set; } = false;
     public Action<string> OutputAction { get; set; } = null;
     public Func<object, string> ArgToStringFunction { get; set; } = null;
     public Encoding ConsoleEncoding { get; set; } = Encoding.UTF8;
 }
 ```

1. `IncludeContext` (default: `true`): Whether to include context information (line number, parent function, etc.) in
   the output.
2. `Prefix` (default: `üçß| `): The prefix of the output.
3. `UseAbsPath` (default: `false`): Whether to use absolute path of the file or the file name only.
4. `OutputAction` (default: `null`): The action to output the result. If it is `null`, the result will be output to
   `Console.WriteLine()` with the color set in `LabelColor`, `FieldColor` and `ValueColor`.
5. `ArgToStringFunction` (default: `obj => JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, new StringEnumConverter())`): The function
   converting the object to a string. If it is `null`, the default function will be used.
6. `LabelColor` (default: `ConsoleColor.DarkBlue`): The color of the label.
7. `FieldColor` (default: `ConsoleColor.DarkRed`): The color of the field.
8. `ValueColor` (default: `ConsoleColor.DarkCyan`): The color of the value.
9. `Encoding` (default: `Encoding.UTF8`): The encoding of the output.

You can use `IceCream.SetXxx(newValue)` (e.g. `IceCream.SetPrefix("ic> ")`) to set a single setting.
If you are using `IceCreamTraditional`, you should use `IceCreamTraditional.SetXxx(newValue)` instead.

### Misc

#### Coloring?

Coloring is possible in C# console, but there are limited color choices. Maybe I'll support coloring in the future, but
for now I don't feel it's that useful.

#### Framework

`>.NET Core 3.1` and `>.NET 5.0` are suggested. `NET Standard 2.0` and `.NET Framework 4.5` are also supported, 
but they may not be able to print the arguments' name. (e.g. `x.ic()` may print `1` instead of `x:1`)
